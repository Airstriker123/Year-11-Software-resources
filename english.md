## Othello english notes term 3 final for multimodal prese

1. The article states that men like Othello with a warrior background tend to honour the culture of being mentally and physically hardened. Instead of questioning Desdemona he decided to solve the problem with his sword.

2. Othello's role represents the complexities of being human in the 16th century, and demonstrating gender roles.

3. By manipulating Othello through exploiting his insecurities of his anxieties and anger.


Racial prejudice:

```
Iago - dehumanizing Roderigo using him as a tool to fund his evil plan to get revenge against Othello.

Roderigo - manipulated by Iago into thinking he will get Desdemona to love him.

Othello - Othello tries to defend himself with the high risk of being killed, and says to the duke "Her father loved me, oft invited me..."
   	* Desdemona loved listening to Othello's experiences showing an incline in him.
 	* Othello offered Desdemona an escape from her old life

Iago - talking about Desdemona and criticising her saying she should be with someone her own skin and viewing Othello as less and not worthy of being with her, demonstrating his jealously.

 	* within his time the nature order was expected to be follow
 		* god -> kings -> knights -> peasants/slaves

How is Iago able to manipulate within this context:

Iago manipulates Othello through his insecurities and uses the racial prejudice to make others believe that he does not belong as a high ranking official. He manipulates Roderigo by promising to make Desdemona fall in love with him, funding his plot of taking over Othello's place and using the nature order to create a racial prejudice to have think's go his way.

My life upon her faith!

Honest Iago,

My Desdemona must I leave to thee.

I prithee let thy wife attend on her,

And bring them after in the best

Come, Desdemona, I have but an hour

Of love, of worldly matters, and direction
To spend with thee.

We must obey the time.

# Othello to Iago

technques:
```
By the world,

I think my wife be honest and think she is not.

I think that thou art just and think thou art not.

I’ll have some proof! Her name, that was as
fresh As Dian’s visage, is now begrimed and
black

As mine own face. If there be cords, or knives,

Poison, or fire, or suffocating streams,

I’ll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!
```

``slide no 22``

- analysis:
  - conveying her love for him is completly eroded
  - the langauge depicts that Othello criticises Desdemona by calling her tears fake 
  - Shakespeare evokes that when one is manipulated love can turn into rage and destruction
    - Seen from Othello's love in desdemona to hating her and killing her
  - Jealousy takes control of Othello 
  - the erosion of love has caused the erosion of othello's mentality (he becomes unstable due to love)
  - Shakespeare shakes that speare to convey to us that love is a powerful emotion which can shape one's identity of self.
  - Othello uses Desdemona as a means to escape his own tragic pstd 
    - when she is taken away from him he becomes unstable and is unable to cope with his insecurities
      - which leads to her death

## examples of good and bad presentation

good:
Clarity - spoke clear, easy to listen , rehearsed , confident.

images - complement the script. Minimal text, the images or slight word here and then do the heavy lifting. 
Sophisiticated language and understanding of the metalanguage

- consistent linking to the audience and consistent linking to the audience and understanding
- Conceptual images in some responses (offered intellectual stimulation)

bad: Images could be more conceptual/ engaging concept was not clear from the start - where is the "so what?"

- speaking to fast reduces clarity and cohesion

- Lack of polish 
- not taking enough time to explore the text in response
- make sure to be concise and assertive.
